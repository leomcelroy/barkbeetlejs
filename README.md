This is a web-based CAM program that aims to simplify the process of generating toolpaths from SVGs.

A user only needs to input material and thickness and a milling settings calculator that uses the expertise of Jens Dyvik automatically generates feeds and speeds.

The program defaults to a machine with stiffness comparable to a Shopbot but I will add a stiffness variable soon.
