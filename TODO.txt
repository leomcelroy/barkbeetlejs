**** TODO ****

** Level 0 **

** Level 1 **
- highlight hovered toolpath

- climb and conventional milling
- auto tabs
- auto dogbone
- working icon

- stiffness parameter

** Level 2 **
- import (dxf, makerjs)
- join close curves
- suggest bit type

** Level 3 **
- ramp plunge, and angle

** Level 5 **
- automill
- detecting interior contours
  - auto climb and conventional milling
- place tabs
- display tool in toolpath list
- make toolpath list draggable
- add more info about default settings

**** Done ****
- group toolpaths created at one time
- make toolpath list scrollable
- move origin location
  - adjust gcode to origin
- scale origin with viewer
- drop in upload
- render drill
- recenter
- filenames are off
- move expensive computations to web workers
- table
  - consistent sizing
- reorder toolpaths

**** Maybe ****
- gcode file naming when exporting
- render pockets as solid fill
- update settings when bit sized changed, maybe make this optional auto- update feature
- add known chain flattening and general model flattening to polylines with deviation tolerance (mjs)
- separate select and view for toolpaths

**** Bugs ****
- if profile returns multiple contours need to raise bit when traveling between them
- improve resolution of clipper offsets (like with kiwi example)
- over 50% stepover bug with onion skin pockets, need to do dogbone geometry
