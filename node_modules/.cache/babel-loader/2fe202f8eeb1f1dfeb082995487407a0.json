If p1\n   and p2 are the previous two bytes, we calcualte the context as\n\n     context = kContextLookup[p1] | kContextLookup[p2 + 256].\n\n   If the previous two bytes are ASCII characters (i.e. < 128), this will be\n   equivalent to\n\n     context = 4 * context1(p1) + context2(p2),\n\n   where context1 is based on the previous byte in the following way:\n\n     0  : non-ASCII control\n     1  : \\t, \\n, \\r\n     2  : space\n     3  : other punctuation\n     4  : \" '\n     5  : %\n     6  : ( < [ {\n     7  : ) > ] }\n     8  : , ; :\n     9  : .\n     10 : =\n     11 : number\n     12 : upper-case vowel\n     13 : upper-case consonant\n     14 : lower-case vowel\n     15 : lower-case consonant\n\n   and context2 is based on the second last byte:\n\n     0 : control, space\n     1 : punctuation\n     2 : upper-case letter, number\n     3 : lower-case letter\n\n   If the last byte is ASCII, and the second last byte is not (in a valid UTF8\n   stream it will be a continuation byte, value between 128 and 191), the\n   context is the same as if the second last byte was an ASCII control or space.\n\n   If the last byte is a UTF8 lead byte (value >= 192), then the next byte will\n   be a continuation byte and the context id is 2 or 3 depending on the LSB of\n   the last byte and to a lesser extent on the second last byte if it is ASCII.\n\n   If the last byte is a UTF8 continuation byte, the second last byte can be:\n     - continuation byte: the next byte is probably ASCII or lead byte (assuming\n       4-byte UTF8 characters are rare) and the context id is 0 or 1.\n     - lead byte (192 - 207): next byte is ASCII or lead byte, context is 0 or 1\n     - lead byte (208 - 255): next byte is continuation byte, context is 2 or 3\n\n   The possible value combinations of the previous two bytes, the range of\n   context ids and the type of the next byte is summarized in the table below:\n\n
