Especially useful for rate limiting\n * execution of handlers on events like resize and scroll.\n *\n * @param  {Number}    delay          A zero-or-greater delay in milliseconds. For event callbacks, values around 100 or 250 (or even higher) are most useful.\n * @param  {Boolean}   [noTrailing]   Optional, defaults to false.
