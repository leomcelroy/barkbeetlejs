**** TODO ****
-generate settings from material and thickness inputs
-auto tabs
-place tabs
-auto dogbone
-reorder toolpaths
-gcode file naming when exporting
-move origin location
-box select
-double click to deselect
-ramp plunge, and angle

**** Would Be Good ****
-display tool in toolpath list
-make toolpath list draggable
-import (dxf, makerjs)
-add more info about default settings
-climb and conventional milling
-detecting interior contours

**** Maybe ****
-export same tools into same files and steps
-switch to new framework? library? (my lit system, svelte, solidjs)
-default export all gcode files when none selected
-replace react with lit-html
-import (bbjs) appends to open file instead of overwriting it
-update settings when bit sized changed, maybe make this optional auto-update feature
-improve clipper library integration
-add known chain flattening and general model flattening to polylines with deviation tolerance (mjs)
-peasant 3d isometric hack view
-convert functions which render jsx to stateless components (capital names and called as components not functions)
-separate select and view for toolpaths

**** Probably Not ****
-add number of selected paths to toolpath generator
-convert arcs to relative coordinates

**** Bugs ****
-if profile returns multiple contours need to raise bit when traveling between them
-improve resolution of clipper offsets (like with kiwi example)
-over 50% stepover bug with onion skin pockets, need to do dogbone geometry
SQUASHED - Editing general settings doesn't propagate to settings in toolpath generation till toggling the toolpath button
SQUASHED - if there is no output outline from profile then gcode searching for first point causes crash

**** DONE ****
-create spreadsheet of settings with jens
-cut open paths by tracing them
-generate gcode at export instead of when geometry is generated
-prevent toolpath generation till basic settings are input
-drill
-save/export (bbjs)
-import (bbjs)
-concatenate gcodes
-add svg flattening to polylines
-integrate clipper library
-import (svg)
-add lists of existing toolpaths
-add selection
-add highlighting
-pin toolpath editting tools to bottom of list
-profile
-add toolpath naming
-delete toolpaths
-delete geometry
-clarify what pocket and profile return (I think profile returns list of contours and pocket a list of models)
